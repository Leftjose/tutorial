## Regex Components

### Anchors

- Anchors don't match anyother character. They match a position before or after the character.

  - (^) a caret anchor matches the start of the text
  - ($) a dollar sign mtches the end of the text

### Quantifiers

- A quantifier indicates a number of characters or expressoins to match

- These are some characters used in quantofiers
  -(x\*)

  -(x+)

  -(x?)

  - Repeated pattern
  - Counting Charaters
  - Optional Character

### Grouping Constructs

- A grouping construct helps delineate subexpressions of a regular expression and capture the substrings of an input string.

  - We can use grouping contructs for the following

    - match subexpressiones that are repeated in the input string
    - multiple regular expression language elements
    - retrieve individual subexpressions from the match.groups property

### Bracket Expressions

-Bracket expressions are either a matching list expression or a non-matching ;ist expression. It is made up of one or more expressions

    - Ordinary characters 
    - collating elements
    - collating symbols
    - equivalence classes 
    - character classes 


### Character Classes

- Character classes are very simple. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters.

    - ASCII Characters 
    - Alphanumeric Characters
    - NON-word Characters 
    - Space and bar 

### The OR Operator

- 

### Flags

### Character Escapes
